# ZnSSe_CVT

A series of MatLab codes to simulate the growth properties in a linear furnace in chemical vapor transport technique. 

This was master degree project in which I had to grow ZnSSe crystals with CVT. To find the weight ratio and the 
temperture difference curve I had to simulate first. 

Hope it comes handy for someone, somewhere!

Cheers!
